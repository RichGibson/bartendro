This is a forked version of the original Bartendro software which 
supports the [Hello Drinkbot](https://www.facebook.com/groups/602734573508700) project

(the original hellodrinkbot.com domain was lost, and now appears to be a malware 
distribution vector)

# Quickstart for Hello Drinkbot fork



- git clone https://github.com/RichGibson/hellodrinkbot.git
- cd bartendro/ui
- #this requires python 2.7, for now. If you use Conda this works:
- conda create --name py27 python=2.7
- conda activate py27
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- cp bartendro.db.default bartendro.db
- sh ./start_bartendro.sh
